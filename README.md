# JavaScript-based-BickBreaker

### Greetings! 

I created this project for the sole purpose of experimenting, learning, and understanding how vanilla javascript works.
This project points out that I understand the basics of vanilla JS (*variables, objects, arrays, simple functions, repetitive constructions, recursive functions, etc*) and I am capable of applying them.

**Hope you have a nice day! ;)**
